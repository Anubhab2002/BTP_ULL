[SEP] in 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor john harvard. interestingly, johnharvard himself was a clergyman. [SEP] it seems that harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion. [SEP] therefore, it \u2019 s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note harvard. [SEP] wow, i didn \u2019 t know that religion had played such an important role in harvard history. [SEP] religion has been playing an indispensible part in harvard history as well as the u. s. [SEP] i finally begin to get to know harvard. it seems that my knowledge of harvard is rather poor. i have a lot work to do before applying for harvard. [SEP] remember that harvard is a part of the united states. so you have to know the u. s. history and culture if you want to have in - depth knowledge of harvard. the two are closely related.

[SEP] well, you can pay by mail, telegraphic or swift transfer. or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary. [SEP] which is the best way? [SEP] it depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money. a swift transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest. how much do you wanna send? [SEP] $ 800. [SEP] why don't you send it by mail payment order? [SEP] how long does it take? [SEP] about a week. [SEP] i don't know. can i send it more quickly? [SEP] sure. you can have a telegraphic or a swift transfer. [SEP] and how long do those take? [SEP] both a telegraphic transfer and a swift transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days, depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank. [SEP] i see. how can i pay by telegraphic transfer? [SEP]",

[SEP] well, we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start. [SEP] what else can we do to protect the environment? [SEP] if you do have to drive, you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol. also, your home should use sources of renewable energy. [SEP] how about recycling? does that actually help?
