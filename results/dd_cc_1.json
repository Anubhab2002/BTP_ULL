That \u2019 s a foul. </s> I know how goals are scored in football, but how about in rugby? </s> If a team carries the ball over the goal line, they score points. A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch. </s> There \u2019 s a lot more physical contact in rugby, isn \u2019 t there? </s> Yes. Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball. This is called \u201d tackling \u201d, as in football. </s> The ball is a different shape in rugby, isn \u2019 t it? </s> Yes. It \u2019 s not perfectly round like a football. A rugby ball is oval in shape. There \u2019 s a match on TV this afternoon. Why don \u2019 t you watch it with me? I \u2019 ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we \u2019 re watching. </s>",
